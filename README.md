# PF Calc

Used to calculate cost, weight and caster level of weapons, armor, potions, wands and scrolls

# Deployment

Uses [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to deploy to github pages. Setup was followed [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

## Running the deployment scripts.

First commit all your changes. Then, to actually deploy the app, simply run:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will increment the minor version number, build and then deploy to github pages.

Afterwards you should push your changes to ensure the repo is up-to-date.
